# objctags

A better ctags-like tag generator for Objective-C as well as C, C++ and Objective-C++.

_objctags_ is based on the abstract syntax tree generated by [LLVM](http://llvm.org) [frontend](http://clang.llvm.org), therefore _objctags_ would generally have a noticeably poor performance comparing to other regex-based tags generator especially when dealing with very large source files.

Currently, _objctags_ is still a working prototype, it has a lot of issues and a lot could be improved.

## How to Install

### Build from Sources

_objctags_ requires CMake (at least version 2.8) to be built, and _objctags_ depends on LLVM static libraries (you have to install LLVM including Clang from sources, Xcode and Xcode command line tools do not come with these static libraries).

__Install CMake and LLVM with Homebrew__

```bash
brew update
brew install cmake
brew install llvm --with-clang --with-asan --disable-assertions
```

__Build objctags__

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lembacon/objctags.git
cd objctags/build && cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
make && make install
```

### Download Pre-built Binary

If you are using OS X Mountain Lion, you can [download](http://lmb.bz/pGFj/2xND7WB4) pre-built objctags and put it somewhere in you $PATH.

## How to Use

For C and C++, objctags will generate ctags-compatible tag file. However, for Objective-C and Objective-C++, objctags defines a few new tag kinds.

See ```objctags --help``` for available options.

If you are using [Tagbar](http://majutsushi.github.com/tagbar), objctags has provided a configuration file for that.

```bash
objctags --vim-conf >~/.vim/plugin/objctags.vim
```
